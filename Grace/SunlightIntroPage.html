      <p> <font color="white">  The Epipelagic Zone, or Sunlight Zone, is the layer of the ocean
         that ranges from the surface down until 656ft below sea level. Some animals
           rise up from the Mesopelagic zone (zone below this) at night to feed. <BR><BR>
          The Epipelagic zone contains a thousands of animals including dolphins, jellyfish,
          most sharks, coral, and a variety of phytoplankton and algae. In the following pages,
          we will look at the different interactions between animals on this layer of the ocean
          as well as how they can interact with animals from the Mesopelagic zone. More specifically
          we will be looking at Coral Reefs, Blacktip Reef Sharks, Anchovies, and the Lantern Fish.
